<H1>Traditional bank vs P2P lending site</H1>
<P class="LHS bank">From the lender's perspective, borrowing from a bank means the bank is the only source of capital for the loans. They will bear more risk and they will offer loans with a higher interest rate. Also, they cannot lend a large sum of money to a startup because of risks and little to no credit history for reference.</P>
<P class="RHS p2p">For peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform, since there could be a large pool of lenders for the same company, the risk of lending money is spread out, hence each lender can offer a small amount of loans and still earn interest from that loan. Individual lenders need to evaluate the risk themselves before lending money to another party.</P>
<P class="LHS bank">From the borrower's perspective, borrowing from a bank means you need to have a good credit history. Otherwise, it would be harder to obtain a large sum of loan, especially for startups. Also, the interest rate of the loan will be higher since the lending bank is the sole provider of capital and its risk is higher. Borrowing from bank also require more time for the loan to process, since the bank needs to check the credit score of the borrower to approve the loan.</P>
<P class="RHS p2p">For P2P lending platform, the application for loan on the P2P lending website is much simpler than doing that in a bank. The interest rate offered on P2P lending website is lower than the interest rate offered in banks. It is possible for borrowers to lend a larger amount of loan in P2P lending website if his/her credit history is not good.</P>
