<H1>Use of blockchain in Nestle Infant Formula</H1>
<P class="nestle LHS">At each point in the supply chain, the company responsible for handling the raw ingredients / semi-finished product can record the date, time and location of their manufacturing plant into the blockchain. Since all the data recorded in the blockchain cannot be modified, by scanning the QR code on a product, customers can access the origin, date of manufacture and the identity of each company in the supply chain of the infant formula they purchase. They can access these information anywhere and be confident that they are not manipulated by other parties. They can know more about the supply chain it went through before making a purchase.</P>
<P class="nestle LHS">For the infant formula company, if a can of infant formula has failed quality control, the company can traceback the supply chain that batch of product went through by accessing that block in the blockchain. They can find out the manufacturing date, time and name of each company in the supply chain. They can investigate whether there is a problem in a particular company in the supply chain, identify the cause and contact the responsible company to fix the problem in manufacturing immediately. Also, it would be easier for the infant formula company to recall a specific batch of defective product since they can just check the information on the block in the blockchain.</P>
